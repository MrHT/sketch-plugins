# Sketch Plugins

This is a collection of plugins I've written for Bohemian Coding's
[Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

## 1. [Symbols](https://github.com/tisho/sketch-plugins/tree/master/Symbols)

## DEPRECATED: Symbols are now part of Sketch 3.

Symbols lets you mimic basic Smart Objects / Symbols functionality by automatically syncing changes between layer groups named in a particular way. As an added bonus, you can mark certain text layers in your symbols as dynamic and have their styles replicated, but not their content.
